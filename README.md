# Free_Trivia_App
Over 900 trivia questions to keep you sharp!

# Technology Used
Java, Android Studios, and Volley Library (for the HTTP requests)

# Approach Taken
Model View Controller Architecture to keep code organized and effecient. HTTP requests with JSON output from an API to populate the question bank. Focused more on styling by using Google Fonts and Animations to have a more polished feel than my previous apps.

# Unsolved Problems
The simple use of the question bank allows a user go hit the back button and re-attempt a question that they got incorrect. They could also hit the back previous button and continually rack up their score by resubmitting correct answers in that manner.

# Next Steps
Remove the previous button and implement a random selection from the question bank. Set up a boolean value for if the question has been used and populate the question bank without used questions for the next selection.
